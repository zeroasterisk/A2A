## Use Case Highlights

A2A unlocks powerful new ways for AI agents to collaborate and solve complex problems. Here are a few examples of what's possible:

- **Multi-Agent Workflows:** Chain specialized agents together to automate complex processes, like candidate sourcing for hiring or streamlining supply chain logistics.
- **Agent Marketplaces:** Create platforms where agents can discover and utilize the capabilities of other agents from different providers.
- **Cross-Platform Integration:** Connect agents built on different frameworks—like LangGraph, BeeAI, and more—to work together seamlessly.
- **Evaluating Multi-Agent Systems:** Use frameworks like Vertex AI to assess the performance and success of collaborative agent trajectories.
